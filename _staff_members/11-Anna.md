My name is Anna Strassen and I come from Germany. I moved to the Netherlands in 2018 to study psychology and would now like to stay in this beautiful country on the long-term. 
I'm interested in both research and clinical practice, which is why I am combining the research master in developmental psychology with the master in clinical child and adolescent psychology. I chose to write my thesis in the “Angst bij Kinderen” lab, because I want to contribute to helping children overcome their fears. Additionally I am curious to gain a more thorough understanding of the causes, maintaining factors, and treatments of anxiety disorders and phobias.
