I am a Distinguished Professor of Psychology, an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow, and the Founding Director of the Centre for Emotional Health. I have a background in clinical psychology, especially the understanding and development of mental disorders. I have a history of developing treatment programs and evaluating their efficacy through clinical trials. Foremost among these has been the Cool Kids suite of programs. The Cool Kids programs are now translated into over 25 languages and used in over 30 countries.
